# Behavioral-Pattern-Mining-in-NYC-Squirrel-Data
Enhanced data interpretability by transforming boolean attributes into descriptive strings for effective preprocessing of the 2018 NYC Central Park Squirrel Census data. Implemented A-Priori algorithm to extract association rules from 3,000+ rows with 70% support and 80% confidence, identifying patterns like the calm behavior of adult squirrels.
